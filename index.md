# Guide for Carpentries Workshop Administrators


### What does a Workshop Administrator do?


The role of the regional workshop administrator is to be the front face of the Carpentries, promoting our work and our culture in their geographical area.  The workshop administrator will manage workshop logistics, communicate with hosts and instructors, and respond to general inquiries.  As a team, all administrators will  work together to support each other and ensure communities can thrive locally while maintaining quality and consistency globally.

### How does the Workshop Administrator actually do all that?

The Carpentries have developed a set of guidelines to ensure all workshops have the same level of quality and consistency.  This includes using our internal systems and databases as well as tools like Eventbrite and Survey Monkey.  The guidelines are outlined in [this manual](#).  


### What if I want to run my own Carpentries workshops?

That's great! You can run a self-organized workshop provided you follow these [requirements](#). You can use the Administrator's manual above for guidance, but we will not provide any direct support.

If you'd like one of our Workshop Administrators to manage all this for you, please fill out our [workshop request form](#) and we will follow up with you to get started planning. For this we charge a workshop fee of US$2500, plus any costs for instructor travel (due directly to them).
