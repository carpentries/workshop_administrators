#### What are some common questions that we want canned responses for?


### In a nutshell, what are the Carpentries about and how do the workshops run?

Software Carpentry (SWC) and Data Carpentry (DC) are two sibling organizations. Both programs offer two day long workshops taught by a team of two instructors, trained and certified by us. Software Carpentry focuses on best practices in computational programming that help scientists and researchers be more effective with their work. Lessons are domain agnostic and use generic data. All Software Carpentry workshops always cover three core areas: shell scripting (bash), version control (Git), and a programming language (R or Python, your choice). Read more here (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). Data Carpentry has a similar foundation but focuses on the data lifecycle, from cleaning & organization to analysis & visualization. Lessons and the data they use are domain specific, with offerings in ecology/biology, genomics, geospatial data, and more in the works. Read more here (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/ ).

All workshops have a standard fee of US$2500, plus any costs for instructor travel (which may include airfare, ground travel, hotel, and meals/incidentals).
You can read more about the costs and how to request a workshop here for Software Carpentry (https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/) and here for Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-host/).

Workshops are offered on demand, not on a set schedule, and typically require 2-3 months lead time to plan.
