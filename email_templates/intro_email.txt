Hi everyone,

This email is to introduce %host_first_name% %host_last_name% of %site_name% with instructors %instructor1_first_name% %instructor1_last_name% and %instructor2_first_name% %instructor2_last_name%. They will be teaching a %carpentry_type% workshop on %workshop_date%.

Next steps:

Instructors will work directly with %host_first_name% to make travel arrangements. We are not part of this process. This may include airfare, ground travel, hotel, and meals/incidentals. %host_first_name%, it is up to you whether you want to book things directly or have instructors make their own arrangements and get reimbursed. Either way, please keep in mind our instructors are volunteering two days of their time to teach with you, so please support them in making travel as smooth as possible.

You can all read more about the roles of workshop hosts, instructors, and helpers here (https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations/). I'll highlight a few things here.

%host_first_name% , can you share a little about who your learners are and what you and they are expecting? That will help our instructors be prepared. We also like to have a couple of helpers at each workshop from the local community. Would you be able to help secure a couple of helpers? They don't need to be connected with us; they just need a good understanding of the technologies we teach and an enthusiasm to help others.

%instructor1_first_name% and %instructor2_first_name%, please feel free to introduce yourselves and share a bit about your backgrounds. We value the background and expertise you bring to this, and want to hear about you.

%instructor1_first_name% and %instructor2_first_name% will divide up the curriculum:

https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/

OR

http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/

to know who's teaching what. One of them will create the workshop's web page on GitHub, which will include workshop details and instructions on what learners will need to install on their computers. The template can be found here:

https://github.com/datacarpentry/workshop-template

OR

https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template

Please use the workshop id %workshop_id%

%host_first_name% , if you want to handle registration internally that's fine. Otherwise SherAaron can work with you to create an Eventbrite registration page. She will need to know a total count, the registration fee (if any, as well as a refund policy), and the exact location. Regardless, all learners should complete pre/post workshop surveys which will be available on the webpage the instructors create.   SherAaron will share links so you all can view survey results.

SherAaron will check in over the next few weeks and after it's all over to hear how it went -- including getting attendance figures, ideally broken out by number registered and number attended each day. Any of you are also welcome to join our instructor discussion sessions before and/or after the workshop. It's a great way to ask questions and share ideas with other instructors before you teach, and to give us feedback after you teach. Check out the schedule and sign up here: http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion

I'm so glad to have everyone confirmed for this. Please email any questions you all may have for me, SherAaron, or each other.

Thanks so much - I'm looking forward to seeing this come together!
