### How to use AMY, the Carpentries' internal database

* Log in to AMY [here](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/admin-dashboard/).  Contact Carpentries staff if you need login credentials.

![AMY login screen goes here](images/amy_login_screen.png)

All the menus and a search bar are displayed across the top. The main page has three column view showing published workshops, uninvoiced workshops, and unpublished workshops.

This view can be filtered to show workshops assigned to the logged in administrator, unassigned workshops, or all workshops.

* *Published workshops* have a complete start and end date, a valid url, and a complete location
* *Uninvoiced workshops* are those the invoice status is marked "Invoice not requested"
* *Unpublished workshops* are all workshops that do not meet the criteria to be published

From here you can also add new persons, events, organizations, or airports to the database.
